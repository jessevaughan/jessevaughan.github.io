    </ul>

    <h2>11. Third-Party Content</h2>

    <p>We may provide information about third-party products, services, activities or events, or we may allow third parties to make their content and information available on or through the Services (collectively, “Third-Party Content”). We provide Third-Party Content as a service to those interested in such content. Your dealings or correspondence with third parties and your use of or interaction with any Third-Party Content are solely between you and the third party. Doubles does not control or endorse, and makes no representations or warranties regarding, any Third-Party Content, and your access to and use of such Third-Party Content is at your own risk.</p>

    <h2>12. Indemnification:</h2>

    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Doubles and each of our officers, directors, agents, partners and employees (individually and collectively, the “Doubles Parties”) from and against any losses, liabilities, claims, demands, damages, expenses or costs (“Claims”) arising out of or related to (a) your access to or use of the Services; (b) your User Content or Feedback; (c) your violation of these Terms; (d) your violation, misappropriation or infringement of any rights of another (including intellectual property rights or privacy rights); or (e) your conduct in connection with the Services. You agree to promptly notify Doubles Parties of any third-party Claims, cooperate with Doubles Parties in defending such Claims and pay all fees, costs and expenses associated with defending such Claims (including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees). You also agree that the Doubles Parties will have control of the defense or settlement, at Doubles' sole option, of any third-party Claims. This indemnity is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other indemnities set forth in a written agreement between you and Doubles or the other Doubles Parties.</p>

    <h2>13. Disclaimers</h2>

    <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties. To the extent such exclusions are specifically prohibited by applicable law, some of the exclusions set forth below may not apply. Your use of our Services is at your sole risk. Except as otherwise provided in a writing by us, our Services and any content therein are provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. In addition, Doubles does not represent or warrant that our Services are accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free. While Doubles attempts to make your use of our Services safe, we cannot and do not represent or warrant that our Services or servers are free of viruses or other harmful or offensive components. You assume the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Services.</p>

    <h2>14. Limitation of Liability</h2>

    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Doubles and the other Doubles Parties will not be liable to you under any theory of liability—whether based in contract, tort, negligence, warranty, or otherwise—for any indirect, consequential, incidental, or special damages or lost profits, even if Doubles or the other Doubles Parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

    <p>The total liability of Doubles and the other Doubles Parties for any claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Services, regardless of the form of the action, is limited to $100.00.</p>

    <p>The limitations set forth in this Section 14 will not limit or exclude liability for the gross negligence, fraud or intentional misconduct of Doubles or the other Doubles Parties or for any other matters in which liability cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law. Additionally, some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.</p>

    <h2>15. Release</h2>

    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you release Doubles and the other Doubles Parties from responsibility, liability, claims, demands and/or damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown (including, but not limited to, claims of negligence), arising out of or related to disputes between users and the acts or omissions of third parties. If you are a consumer who resides in California, you hereby waive your rights under California Civil Code § 1542, which provides: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”</p>

    <h2>16. Transfer and Processing Data</h2>

    <p>In order for us to provide our Services, you agree that we may process, transfer and store information about you in the United States and other countries, where you may not have the same rights and protections as you do under local law.</p>

    <h2>17. Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration</h2>

    <p>Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Doubles and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration agreement. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial.</p>

    <p>No Representative Actions. You and Doubles agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and Doubles and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.</p>

    <p>Arbitration of Disputes. Except for small claims disputes in which you or Doubles seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes in which you or Doubles seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and Doubles waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services resolved in court. Instead, for any dispute or claim that you have against Doubles or relating in any way to the Services, including disputes or claims relating to privacy and data protection, you agree to first contact Doubles and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim (“Notice”) to Doubles by email at <a href="mailto:support@pickdoubles.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">support@pickdoubles.com</a> or by certified mail addressed to Double Crown Gaming Co., 76 South Park Street, San Francisco, CA 94107. The Notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above. If you and Doubles cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the dispute to binding arbitration administered by JAMS or, under the limited circumstances set forth above, in court. All disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in San Francisco County, CA, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“JAMS Rules”). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on the <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JAMS Website</a> and are hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</p>

    <p>You and Doubles agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 17 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</p>

    <p>The arbitrator, Doubles, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including, but not limited to, all information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.</p>

    <p>You and Doubles agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and Doubles will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Doubles, Doubles will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and Doubles agree that the state or federal courts of the State of California and the United States sitting in San Francisco County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.</p>

    <p>Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that you and Doubles will not have the right to assert the claim.</p>

    <p>You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 17 by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@pickdoubles.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">support@pickdoubles.com</a>. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve disputes in accordance with Section 18.</p>

    <p>If any portion of this Section 17 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 17 or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section 17; and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section 17 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 17 will be enforceable.</p>

    <h2>18. Governing Law and Venue</h2>

    <p>Any dispute arising from these Terms and your use of the Services will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of California, except to the extent preempted by U.S. federal law, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of California and the United States, respectively, sitting in San Francisco County, California.</p>

    <h2>19. Modifying and Terminating our Services</h2>

    <p>We reserve the right to modify our Services or to suspend or stop providing all or portions of our Services at any time. You also have the right to stop using our Services at any time. We are not responsible for any loss or harm related to your inability to access or use our Services.</p>

    <h2>20. Severability</h2>

    <p>If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>

    <h2>21. Additional Terms Applicable to Mobile Devices</h2>

    <p>The following terms apply if you install, access or use the Services on any device that contains the iOS mobile operating system (the “iOS App”) developed by Apple Inc. (“Apple”).</p>

However, you understand and agree that in accordance with these Terms, Doubles has disclaimed all warranties of any kind with respect to the App, and therefore, there are no warranties applicable to the App.</li>
      <li>Product Claims. You and Doubles acknowledge that as between Apple and Doubles, Doubles, not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims relating to the iOS App or your possession and/or use of the iOS App, including, but not limited to (a) product liability claims, (b) any claim that the iOS App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement, and (c) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.</li>

      <li>Third-Party Beneficiary. The parties acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that, upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof).</li>

Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Terms, Sections 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 20, 21 and 22 survive any expiration or termination of these terms.
