    <h2>Welcome to Doubles!</h2>

    <p>Double Crown Gaming Company ("Doubles," “we,” “us”) offers a social online and mobile chat platform via the Doubles application. This Privacy Policy explains how we at Doubles collect, use, and disclose information about you through our websites (including www.doublecrown.co and www.pickdoubles.com) mobile application (the “App”), and other online products and services (collectively, the "Services") or when you otherwise interact with us.</p>

    <p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.</p>
